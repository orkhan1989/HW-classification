## Introduction
Mortgages , student and auto loans and debt consolidation are few examples of credit loans that people seek online. In this assignment, we want to predict credit risk with machine learning techniques and see if we can loan money to customers.  Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so you will need to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes.

## Technical
two main libraries used are imbalanced learn and scikit learn.
